### Hi there, my name is ZsÃ³fi! ðŸ‘‹
<p>(Sophie is the English version of ZsÃ³fi so feel free to call me that.)</p>
<br/>
<h3>In july of 2019 I enrolled in a one-year course at Codecool, Hungary and that was the first time I experienced the fun and challenges behind the stereotype of a programmer.</h3>
<h3> ðŸŒ± I am most fascinated with frontend development but I studied several technologies and languages on both frontend and backend side. I am eager to learn and I like to work with any of them.</h3>
